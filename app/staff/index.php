                <h1>Mr. Randy Christ</h1>
                <h2>Tiger Band Videographer</h2>
                <div class="staffBio">
                  <img class="staffPortrait" src="/img/staff/Randy.jpeg">
                    <p>Mr. Randy Christ has been the "on-field" videographer for Tiger Band since 2010. He is a 1978 graduate of Clemson University where he earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. He marched with Tiger Band for four years as a tenor sax player. Randy was employed by Michelin for over 38 years working in technical fields as a programmer, a system manager, a high performance test driver, and finally as a certified information systems security professional.</p>
                    <p>Currently, Randy is the owner of Moving Images LLC, a supplier of professional videography and photography services.  He enjoys using digital technologies to capture the special moments that tell people’s stories.</p>
                    <p>Randy was already deeply involved in photography when he purchased his first video camera in 1987 just before the birth of his first child. This is when he discovered how powerful and meaningful story telling with video could be. When his children joined the high school marching band, Randy saw an opportunity to record and tell the story of their marching band experience through videography. For six years he documented each marching competition season from a band member's perspective. Around that time, Dr. Bruce Cook, a former Tiger Band Director, created a video compilation from archived film featuring old Tiger Band half time shows. This reinforced in Randy’s mind the importance of having that recorded history.  It was a logical progression from there to Randy shooting video for Tiger Band, and later starting his photo / video business.</p>
                    <p>Randy and his wife, Robin, have two children who graduated from Clemson University.  The children are both Tiger Band alumni as well. Each is also now married to former Tiger Band members. Randy and his family enjoy marching with the Alumni Band at Homecoming when they can.</p>
                    <p>Now, as a member of the Tiger Band staff, Randy is often found interacting with the students while helping them mount GoPro cameras on their instruments prior to their performances. Besides filming the half time performances, he provides footage for special projects that are used for the promotional and recruiting efforts of Tiger Band. He finds it especially rewarding to work with the enthusiastic students on the Tiger Band Media Team.  Randy is thrilled to be back on the field in Death Valley, capturing images and telling the story of one of the best marching bands in the country.</p>
